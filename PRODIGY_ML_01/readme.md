Task 1: House Price Prediction
This project involves building a simple linear regression model to predict house prices based on key features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. The steps involved include:

Data Collection: Acquiring a dataset containing information about house prices and their features.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the data, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.
Model Training: Training a linear regression model on the preprocessed data.
Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared.
Prediction: Using the trained model to predict prices for new houses based on their features.

Task 3: Cat vs Dog Classification
In this project, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is implemented to classify images of cats and dogs using the TensorFlow Datasets (TFDS) Cats vs Dogs dataset. The approach includes:

Data Loading: Utilizing the TFDS to load the Cats vs Dogs dataset.
Data Preprocessing: Resizing, normalizing, and augmenting the images to improve model performance.
Model Training: Training the SVM classifier on a subset of the dataset.
Evaluation: Measuring the model's accuracy on the validation set.
Testing: Demonstrating the model's classification capability on sample images.

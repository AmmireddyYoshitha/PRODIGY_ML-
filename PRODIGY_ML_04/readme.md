Task 4: Hand Gesture Recognition
This project focuses on developing a hand gesture recognition model for intuitive human-computer interaction. The approach involves:

Dataset Collection: Gathering images or video frames of various hand gestures.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, augmenting, and preparing the data for model training.
Model Architecture: Employing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract features from the images.
Model Training: Training the CNN on the gesture dataset.
Evaluation: Assessing the model's accuracy in recognizing and classifying hand gestures.
Application: Enabling gesture-based control systems and seamless interaction between users and devices.

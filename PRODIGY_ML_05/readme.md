Task 5: Food Recognition and Calorie Estimation
The objective of this project is to develop a model that recognizes food items from images and estimates their calorie content. The approach includes:

Data Collection: Acquiring a diverse dataset with images of food items and their calorie values.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, normalizing, and augmenting the images.
Model Architecture: Using CNNs to recognize food items and predict their calorie content.
Model Training: Training the model on the food dataset.
Evaluation: Measuring the model's accuracy in identifying food items and estimating calories.
Application: Providing users with estimated calorie values to help them maintain a healthy diet and monitor nutritional intake.

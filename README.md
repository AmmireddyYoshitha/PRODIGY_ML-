# Prodigy Internship - Machine Learning

I am immensely grateful to Prodigy Infotech for providing me with the opportunity to work on these projects and for the invaluable support and guidance throughout my internship journey. Below is an overview of my approach to the tasks assigned to me:

## Task 1: House Price Prediction

This project involves building a simple linear regression model to predict house prices based on key features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. The steps involved include:

- **Data Collection**: Acquiring a dataset containing information about house prices and their features.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning the data, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.
- **Model Training**: Training a linear regression model on the preprocessed data.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared.
- **Prediction**: Using the trained model to predict prices for new houses based on their features.

## Task 2: Customer Segmentation

This project aims to segment customers of a retail store based on their purchase history using K-means clustering. The steps include:

- **Data Generation**: Creating a synthetic dataset that includes customer purchase frequency and total amount spent.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Normalizing the data and preparing it for clustering.
- **Clustering**: Applying the K-means algorithm to group customers into distinct clusters.
- **Visualization**: Visualizing the resulting clusters to interpret the segmentation.
- **Insights**: Providing actionable insights for tailored marketing strategies and product offerings.

## Task 3: Cat vs Dog Classification

In this project, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is implemented to classify images of cats and dogs using the TensorFlow Datasets (TFDS) Cats vs Dogs dataset. The approach includes:

- **Data Loading**: Utilizing the TFDS to load the Cats vs Dogs dataset.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Resizing, normalizing, and augmenting the images to improve model performance.
- **Model Training**: Training the SVM classifier on a subset of the dataset.
- **Evaluation**: Measuring the model's accuracy on the validation set.
- **Testing**: Demonstrating the model's classification capability on sample images.

## Task 4: Hand Gesture Recognition

This project focuses on developing a hand gesture recognition model for intuitive human-computer interaction. The approach involves:

- **Dataset Collection**: Gathering images or video frames of various hand gestures.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, augmenting, and preparing the data for model training.
- **Model Architecture**: Employing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract features from the images.
- **Model Training**: Training the CNN on the gesture dataset.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing the model's accuracy in recognizing and classifying hand gestures.
- **Application**: Enabling gesture-based control systems and seamless interaction between users and devices.

## Task 5: Food Recognition and Calorie Estimation

The objective of this project is to develop a model that recognizes food items from images and estimates their calorie content. The approach includes:

- **Data Collection**: Acquiring a diverse dataset with images of food items and their calorie values.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, normalizing, and augmenting the images.
- **Model Architecture**: Using CNNs to recognize food items and predict their calorie content.
- **Model Training**: Training the model on the food dataset.
- **Evaluation**: Measuring the model's accuracy in identifying food items and estimating calories.
- **Application**: Providing users with estimated calorie values to help them maintain a healthy diet and monitor nutritional intake.

These projects have provided me with practical experience in applying machine learning techniques to real-world problems. I am grateful to Prodigy Infotech for this enriching internship experience.
